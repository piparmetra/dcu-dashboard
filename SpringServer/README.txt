Hello everyone,
This document will provide more information about the base for the group assignemnt for v1.0 server.

The projet is deployed only on localhost for now on port 8080, but the database is on the common AWS database.

You will find in this repository :
	->folder "sprinJwt-main" is the Spring Maven project for the server.
	->folder "postman_screenshot" contains examples of how the few controllers I've made are working (and can be reached from Frontend).

for the Spring application, you may need to create your own workspace and import the Maven project.


Fell free to modify it you need more Entity for the prject or controllers.

Brice.
