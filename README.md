# EE417 - Web Application Development: Group E Repository

Welcome to the Group E repository for the EE417 Web Application Development course. This is where we'll collaborate on our project, share code, and track our progress.

## Repository Structure

- **Main Branch**: This is for stable versions of our project. Pull requests to this branch require approval.
- **Develop Branch**: Use this branch for ongoing development. It's where we merge our feature branches for testing before they're ready for the main branch.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Make sure you have a local copy of the repository for your work.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: When working on a new feature or fix, branch off from the develop branch. Name your branch clearly based on the work you're doing.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: As you work, commit your changes with clear messages.
4. **Pull Request**: Once you're ready, create a pull request against the develop branch for review.
5. **Merge**: After your pull request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the develop branch.

## Module Information
- **Module:** Web Application Development
- **Assignment Type:** Group Assignment/Project
- **Total Marks:** 40

## Overview
This is a collaborative assignment for groups of 7 or 8, requiring the construction of a web application. Despite the group effort, assessments will consider both collective (50%) and individual contributions (50%). It's crucial to adhere to DCU's Academic Integrity policy strictly.

## Requirements
- **Objective:** Create a "Smart DCU Data Dashboard" web application using relevant technologies.
- **Technologies:** Use any IDE and Frameworks, but stick to core techniques taught in the module (e.g., Java Spring boot instead of PHP).
- **Functionalities:** At least 5 static and dynamic pages, client-side JavaScript, a back-end database, multiple user roles with login functionality, and deployment on EC2 cloud or a packaged WAR file.
- **Documentation and Demonstration:** Comprehensive project documentation and a project demonstration via screencast or screenshots.

## Assessment Goals
- Understand and apply the Web Application Development Life-Cycle.
- Balance design, navigation, and backend functionalities.
- Implement effective front-end, back-end, and database tiers.
- Demonstrate teamwork, quality assurance, and web application deployment.

## Web Application Theme
- **Theme:** Smart DCU Data Dashboard, focusing on campus data visualization like occupancy, air quality, and noise levels. Creativity in data sources and structure is encouraged.

## Data Visualization and User Roles
- **Visualization Tools:** Suggested libraries include Plotly.js, Chart.js, D3.js, and Google Chart.
- **User Authentication:** Implement an authentication system distinguishing between viewers and admin roles.

## Roles and Responsibilities
Potential roles include project management, front-end development, server-side programming, database management, testing, cloud deployment, code repository management, documentation, and project demonstration. Flexibility in role assignment is encouraged.

## Submission Instructions
1. **Initial Planning:** Document outlining application structure, roles, and responsibilities due by March 8th, 2024.
2. **Final Submission:** Includes minutes of meetings, source code, deployment packages, database scripts, installation instructions, project documentation, and demonstration screencast or screenshots.
3. **Individual Contribution:** One-page summary detailing individual contributions.

Ensure adherence to the submission guidelines to facilitate a smooth evaluation process.
