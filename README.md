# EE417 - Web Application Development: Group E Repository

Welcome to the Group E repository for the EE417 Web Application Development course. This is where we'll collaborate on our project, share code, and track our progress.

## Repository Structure

- **Main Branch**: This is for stable versions of our project. Pull requests to this branch require approval.
- **Develop Branch**: Use this branch for ongoing development. It's where we merge our feature branches for testing before they're ready for the main branch.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Make sure you have a local copy of the repository for your work.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: When working on a new feature or fix, branch off from the develop branch. Name your branch clearly based on the work you're doing.
3. **Commit Your Changes**: As you work, commit your changes with clear messages.
4. **Pull Request**: Once you're ready, create a pull request against the develop branch for review.
5. **Merge**: After your pull request has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the develop branch.
